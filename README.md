# Circuit-Chics
BlackWings Hackathon Project 
## **Inspiration**

We've observed a consistent pattern in the communities we've lived in and those we hail from that despite the widespread integration of STEM, women of color continue to be underrepresented. This observation extends to school districts and communities, highlighting a persistent absence of women in tech academically, particularly in middle and high schools where limited classes are offered. The challenges are multifaceted, ranging from societal discrimination to financial constraints and the stereotypes that women aren't generally interested in entering tech. Also, most of the existing learning platforms provide a one-size-fits-all approach, and often fails  to address the unique challenges faced by young female and non binary students in underrepresented communities, contributing to education disparities.  This inspired us to think innovatively to solve the problems of these underrepresented youth. Pursuing a STEM education is not just about interest; it's about creating a secure and inclusive space. Pegasus connect, with its tutoring services, aims to be that safe space for young women to learn about STEM, breaking down barriers and making learning accessible.

## What it does

Through our web app, students can take a gamified interactive quiz to understand their current knowledge and or skill level of a particular STEM area, and based on the assessment, they are matched with a tutor using our matching algorithms. The app also suggests a personalized learning path.

## How we built it 

We built the web app using java, react Swift,with the design prototyped in Figma.  The backend + hardware was written entirely in my SQL and deployed on a (insert raspberry pi that used HTML for our  our frontend. )

## Challenges we ran into
One of our team mates had challenges with internet  downtimes which may it made it a bit challenging to collaborate. Learning a language and the time constraint that came with putting the project together was another challenge.  We were based in 3 different zones globally  but still managed to have syncs, and touch base to finish project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

This early version works, from testing we were to match students to tutors

## What we learned

We learned how to ideate and define user requirements for a product under rapid fire. Additionally we learned how to integrate an HTML web app with a backend MySQL database. We also learned how to use Figma to create design prototypes.  Finally, we learned how to do it afraid as everyone on the team was participating in a Hackathon for the first time. We learnt to lean into our individual strengths while working cohesively as a team.

## What's next for Pegasus Connect

We would like to:
Spend more time refining the idea and piloting an MVP.


## Team Members

### Emma Unuode (Project Manager, Grad student in Business innovation and eBusiness  @ Birkbeck University of London)

Emma was the Project Manager and oversaw all aspects of the project. This included guiding the team and keeping everyone on board with our main idea and meeting deadlines. She was also directly involved in the figma prototyping, and project abstract outlining problem, user requirements and product features.

### Pooja  Garlapati (Frontend Engineer, Computer Engineering Major  @ Louisiana University)

Pooja worked  on the frontend of our project. She made sure that this was a great resource for our final presentation that would demonstrate what our app can really do. 

### Derinell Rojas (Backend Engineer, Computer Science Major @ Boston University)

Derinell worked on the backend of our project She put together the database to look into what the best way to collect the relevant information  help with matching students to the tutors. She also helped make sure that all aspects of the project were completed.

### Alaa Ahmed (Frontend Engineer, Recent Grad student in Engineering @ Alexandria University, Egypt)

Alaa, another frontend engineer, was responsible for creating the landing page of our web application.
